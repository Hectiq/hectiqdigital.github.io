Design Connected is an architecture agency that specializes in providing outstanding 3D models for design furniture. Recently, they approached our team at Hectiq with a request to develop an enhanced version of their plugin for 3ds Max, a popular 3D modeling and animation software.

After carefully studying the client's requirements and the new plugin interface, our team developed the project with the client's supervision. The result was a successful implementation of the new plugin, which provided Design Connected with improved functionality and enhanced capabilities.

Today, the application has been released and we are currently working on the next phase of the project. This includes providing ongoing support and assistance to help Design Connected get the most out of their new plugin.

Overall, this project has been a great success, and we are proud to have partnered with Design Connected to help them achieve their goals. We look forward to continuing our work with them in the future.
